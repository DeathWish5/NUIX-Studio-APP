By using NUIX-Studio App researchers can connect real and virtual IoT devices, test new IoT devices inside VR environment (and don't even need to buy them!)

Currenly, the architecture can be represented by four layers:
1. **IoT real world devices.**
2. **openHAB server.** Provides:
	* Synchronization with IoT real world devices;
	* Storage of IoT data.
3. **NUIX-Studio Unity App** Provides API for interaction with virtual world.

## Technologies
NUIX-Studio uses the features of [Microsoft's Mixed Reality Toolkit](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity#feature-areas), such as hand tracking and interaction techniques. 

Connection to real-world IoT devices is performed by REST API calls to [openHAB](https://www.openhab.org/download/) server.

## Required software and hardware:
1. Unity 2020
2. openHAB v3.0+

### Additional hardware:
1. Oculus Quest 1 or 2
2. IoT devices

## Setup

[![Watch the video](https://github.com/FedorIvachev/IoThingsLab-ReadmeFiles/blob/master/Readme/Files/v0.6/VideoPreview.png)](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Wy4y1s7cs?share_source=copy_web)

### openHAB installation

1. Install [openHAB](https://openhab.org/docs/installation/)
### openHAB example device adding
2. The server is accessible at <Your IP Address>:8080
3. Go to Settings - Bindings and add Network Binding
4. Go to Things and add a new thing through Network binding Scan
5. Go to Model - Create Equipment from Things and select the recently created thing

### Unity installation

1. [Download Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)
2. Install Unity 2020 through the Installs Tab
3. In the Projects Tab, select Add. Open the dowloaded project (either you cloned it or dowloaded as [zip archive](https://github.com/VRSimulator/NUIX-Studio-Client/archive/master.zip))
4. Download [3DLivingRoom](https://github.com/VRSimulator/NUIX-Studio-Client/releases/download/v0.6-alpha1/3DLivingRoom.unitypackage) package, select Import package - Custom package and then import it.
5. . Run the Scene from \Assets\NUIX-Studio-Client\openHABIntegration\Scenes

## Documentation

IoT device in VR = 3D mesh + sensors. Each sensor is a data item + interactable object in Unity. Data items are stored on the openHAB server, interactable objects (Widgets) are located in the Assets/NUIX-Studio-Client/openHABIntegration/Prefabs folder.

1. Add real-world IoT devices into openHAB, and they will automatically appear in the NUIX-Studio App. 
2. Enhance these devices' functionality with extra virtual sensors by adding the [supported tags]().
3. Add fully virtual IoT sensors by dragging the Widgets into the Scene in Unity (uncheck Connected to Server for work locally).
4. Work simultaneously with the same IoT data by connecting to the same sever from different devices.

Item Basic Widgets:
| Item | Widget |
| --- | --- |
| Color | Color information (RGB) |
| Contact | Status of contacts, e.g. door/window contacts. Does not accept commands, only status updates. |
| DateTime | Stores date and time |
| Dimmer | Percentage value for dimmers |
| Group | Nest other items / collect them in groups |
| Image | Binary data of an image |
| Location | GPS coordinates |
| Number | Values in number format |
| Player | Allows control of players (e.g. audio players) |
| Rollershutter | Roller shutter Item, typically used for blinds |
| String | Stores texts |
| Switch | Switch Item, used for anything that needs to be switched ON and OFF |
